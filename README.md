Changing in the file
git remote add origin 
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/xsatter/hellogit.git
is used to put all the files on github 
Adding some more changes

red files are changed but not added 
green files are changed and added
If you add the file again you will overwrite the previous add

To unstage a change I can use checkout but I have to specify the
file name
